# SDD Major Project

This Project has been created by Tyler Hardy with the assistance from Paige Reeves, Lucy Huang and Wayne Basham

The Goal of the project is to create a game of chess that is played by the user against an algorithm that creates a list of All
of it's legal moves and, based on that, makes a guess as which move it should take.

The AI should have three - four difficulty levels increasing as development progresses:

--> The AI makes Completely random moves (Testing the methods used to generate the list of legal moves )
--> The AI make moves based on gaining the maximum board control
--> The AI makes moves judging them based on the relative strengths of Both white and black using piece values and board controls
--> The AI Recursively goes down levels of potential moves taking the path that is most likely to increase black's strength.
