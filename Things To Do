Stuff That Needs Implementation:

--> Make a move illegal if a piece is blocking the path. (Rook nearly done, queen causing issues )

--> Promoting Pawns at the end

--> Rules For Movement

--> AI for Black Pieces

--> Be able to choose if you play as black or white.
--> Fix knight movement


Stuff That Works:

--> Displaying The Board

--> Resetting the board

--> If a player attempts to move a piece from an empty cell print try again.

--> Making sure that the turn order is white-black-white-black etc... If a black piece is
    attempting to move when its whites turn print "it's not blacks turn" and then get them to
    re-enter their move.

--> Rules For Movement
--> Check
